It seems like once one group of trash is evicted, another group that is even worse replaces it. There are fights all the time, you can never go without seeing a broken window, people walk by and smack windows in the middle of the night, the elevator is always broken, the list goes on. It is just a miserable place. It is disgusting that no matter how clean you keep your apartment and request pest control there are still bugs. It is gross. I understand the complex is old, however the air conditioning went out three times over the summer, the hot water was out for a three days a couple of times; these are basic necessities that should be taken care of right away or at least taken of the rent. It is just ridiculous.\n",

I hate the noise and I hate everything, but no one should have to worry about stray bullets flying through their window, or some crazy weirdo knocking insistently on their door at 3am looking for drugs. Management's advice is to call the police. That is just common sense if someone is getting their face bashed in front of your window. Why don't they just try to keep out the trash before someone is killed? Stay away from this place at all costs. \n",
